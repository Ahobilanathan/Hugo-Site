The goal is to maximize cumulative rewards over time, making it highly applicable to real-world decision-making tasks such as robotics, game playing, and autonomous systems.
Key Concepts 1. Agent and Environment The agent is the decision-maker, while the environment is everything the agent interacts with. For example, in a self-driving car, the car is the agent, and the road, traffic, and weather are the environment.</description></item><item><title>Neural Networks Explained</title><link>https://yourusername.github.io/ai-tools-hugo-site/posts/2025-05-21-neural-networks-explained/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 18:45:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://yourusername.github.io/ai-tools-hugo-site/posts/2025-05-21-neural-networks-explained/</guid><description>Neural Networks Explained Neural networks are a foundational technology behind modern artificial intelligence (AI), enabling machines to learn from data and make decisions. They mimic the way biological brains process information, making them powerful for tasks like image recognition, natural language processing, and more.
How Neural Networks Work A neural network consists of layers of interconnected nodes, or &amp;ldquo;neurons,&amp;rdquo; that process data through weighted connections. Data flows from input layers, through hidden layers, to output layers, with each neuron applying an activation function to determine its output.</description></item><item><title>AI Ethics and Responsible Development</title><link>https://yourusername.github.io/ai-tools-hugo-site/posts/2025-05-21-ai-ethics-and-responsible-development/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 18:45:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://yourusername.github.io/ai-tools-hugo-site/posts/2025-05-21-ai-ethics-and-responsible-development/</guid><description>AI Ethics and Responsible Development: A Practical Guide Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming industries, but its rapid advancement raises ethical concerns. Ensuring responsible development is essential to maximize benefits and minimize harm.
1. Bias and Fairness AI systems can perpetuate or amplify biases present in training data. For example, facial recognition tools have shown higher error rates for minority groups. Developers must actively test for bias and use diverse datasets to promote fairness.</description></item></channel></rss>
