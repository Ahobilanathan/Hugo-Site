## Understanding Blockchain and AI

### What is Blockchain?

Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that records transactions across multiple computers in a secure, transparent, and tamper-proof manner. Its key features include:

- **Decentralization:** No single entity controls the data.
- **Immutability:** Once data is recorded, it cannot be altered.
- **Transparency:** All participants have access to the ledger.
- **Security:** Cryptographic techniques protect data integrity.

### What is AI?

AI involves developing systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, and language understanding. Key AI subfields include:

- Machine Learning (ML)
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Computer Vision
- Robotics
