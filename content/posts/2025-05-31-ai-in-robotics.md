## Understanding AI in Robotics

### What is AI in Robotics?

AI in robotics refers to the integration of artificial intelligence techniques—such as machine learning, computer vision, natural language processing, and planning—into robotic systems. This fusion allows robots to perform complex tasks autonomously or semi-autonomously, adapt to new environments, and improve their performance over time through learning.

### Key Components of AI in Robotics

- **Sensing and Perception:** Robots use sensors (cameras, LIDAR, microphones) combined with AI algorithms like computer vision to interpret their surroundings.
- **Decision Making:** AI enables robots to analyze data, recognize patterns, and make decisions—such as navigating obstacles or selecting actions.
- **Learning and Adaptation:** Machine learning allows robots to improve their skills through experience, handling tasks with variability.
- **Actuation:** AI guides the robot’s movements and interactions, ensuring precise and safe operations.
