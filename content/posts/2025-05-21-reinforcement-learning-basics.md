# Reinforcement Learning Basics

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with its environment. The goal is to maximize cumulative rewards over time, making it highly applicable to real-world decision-making tasks such as robotics, game playing, and autonomous systems.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Agent and Environment
The **agent** is the decision-maker, while the **environment** is everything the agent interacts with. For example, in a self-driving car, the car is the agent, and the road, traffic, and weather are the environment.

### 2. Rewards and Feedback
The agent receives **rewards** or **penalties** based on its actions. For instance, in playing chess, capturing a piece yields a positive reward, while losing a piece incurs a penalty. The agent aims to learn actions that maximize these rewards over time.

### 3. Policy and Value Functions
- **Policy**: A strategy that defines the action to take in a given state. Example: "If the traffic light is red, stop."
- **Value Function**: Estimates the expected cumulative reward of states or state-action pairs. This helps the agent evaluate the long-term benefit of actions.

### 4. Exploration vs. Exploitation
The agent must balance **exploration** (trying new actions to discover better strategies) and **exploitation** (using known actions that yield high rewards). For example, a robot might explore different paths before settling on the most efficient route.

## Conclusion

Reinforcement Learning empowers systems to learn optimal behaviors through trial and error, guided by rewards. Understanding these core concepts is essential for developing applications where autonomous decision-making improves over time.
