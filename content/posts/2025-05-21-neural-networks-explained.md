# Neural Networks Explained

Neural networks are a foundational technology behind modern artificial intelligence (AI), enabling machines to learn from data and make decisions. They mimic the way biological brains process information, making them powerful for tasks like image recognition, natural language processing, and more.

## How Neural Networks Work

A neural network consists of layers of interconnected nodes, or "neurons," that process data through weighted connections. Data flows from input layers, through hidden layers, to output layers, with each neuron applying an activation function to determine its output.

## Main Points

### 1. Learning Through Training
Neural networks learn by adjusting connection weights based on error. For example, in image classification, the network compares its predictions to true labels and updates weights via backpropagation to improve accuracy over time.

### 2. Feature Extraction
Neural networks automatically discover features in data. For instance, in facial recognition, early layers might detect edges, while deeper layers recognize complex features like eyes or mouths.

### 3. Handling Complex Data
Neural networks excel at modeling non-linear relationships. For example, in predicting stock prices, they can capture intricate market patterns that traditional linear models might miss.

### 4. Versatility Across Domains
Neural networks are adaptable. They are used in speech-to-text applications, autonomous vehicle perception, and recommendation systems, showcasing their broad utility.

## Conclusion

Neural networks are a powerful, flexible tool that enables machines to learn from data, recognize patterns, and make decisions. Understanding their basic operation helps in leveraging AI technologies effectively across various applications.
